 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 We run recruitment twice each year in the Spring and Fall semesters! Our recruitment period usually starts 1-2 weeks into A or C term. Our recruitment schedule will be finalized closer to the beginning of the term, so find our facebook event at the beginning of the semester!
 During our recruitment period, we ask that potential members come to one service, fellowship, brother meeting, and info session to be considered for a bid. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, we are making accommodations so that all these requirements can be done online. WPI students can join Alpha Phi Omega whether they are studying on campus or remotely.

 <p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once the recruitment period has ended, bids are given to potential members that have shown interest in joining Alpha Phi Omega. Those that accept their bids enter a period of pledging, where they have some service, fellowship, and leadership requirements, learn about Alpha Phi Omega, and get to know the members of our chapter. Each pledge is given a “Big” to help mentor them through this process.</p>

		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Our chapter runs a Big-Little program. During the pledging process, each pledge is paired up with at least one brother to be their ‘Big’. The Big acts as a friend, mentor, and brother to look up to within the chapter. Big’s meet with their ‘Little’s’ (the pledge) regularly during the pledging process to help the pledges get through their requirements and to answer any questions the pledges may have. Often times, a brother will have two Bigs or one Big will have two Little’s at the same time. This program creates ‘family-trees’ where many brothers are connected through their various Big-Little connections. This is a great way to make friends within the chapter outside of your age group/class. These Big-Little connections last beyond the pledging process and help to bring the chapter closer together.

			<h4 class="">Q. Can I join Alpha Phi Omega and still be in a social fraternity/sorority on campus?</h4>		
		<p>Yes! Alpha Phi Omega is categorized as a service fraternity, so you can participate in both our organization and other greek life on campus. We actually think it's really good when our members are in several other clubs because that makes it easier to do events with other groups.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 mx-auto text-center">
		<h4 class="">Q. What Service Organizations do you work with?</h4>
		<p>We work with many organizations in and around the Worcester area such as Habitat for Humanity, Community Harvest Project, Mustard Seed Soup Kitchen, Wachusett Greenways, Audubon Society, Tower Hill Botanical Garden, and Relay for Life.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 mx-auto text-center">
		  <h4 class="">Q. Why do students join APO?</h4>
		  <p>Most of our members come to APO looking for service opportunities, either to continue service-oriented habits they formed in high school or to give back to the campus and community. We often find that students come for the service and stay for the fellowship and leadership! </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 mx-auto text-center">
		<h4 class="">Q. Does APO have a house?</h4>
		<p>We do not have a house - this is one of the things that sets us apart from social fraternities and sororities. We do have an office on the third floor of Olin where we can store our supplies, do homework, and have meetings!</p>
