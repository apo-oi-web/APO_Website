<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendship is one of the most important aspects of membership in Alpha Phi Omega. While leadership and service activities are excellent opportunities to build friendship, we also host many social events where members are able to spend time together in a more relaxed environment. We call these events “fellowships”. Fellowships can take many different forms. They can be as simple as a few members meeting to study together, play games, or watch a movie, or they can involve traveling off-campus for activities like hiking, bowling, and ice skating. Our chapter especially likes food-based fellowships; some of our most popular events include sparkling cider and cheese night, Monday trips to Moe’s Southwest Grill, and our semesterly brownie social. Fellowships are usually organized by our Fellowship Vice Presidents, but there are exceptions. Any time that five or more members decide to do something social together (even if it has no other connection to Alpha Phi Omega), that event can be considered an “impromptu” fellowship.

<div class="row"> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Every year, the Omicron Iota chapter holds several large fellowships that are more involved and organized than ordinary events. The most significant examples of these are our Semiformal in the fall and Formal in the spring. With fun themes, music, superlatives, and a large potluck buffet, these events give members the chance to dress up and unwind at the end of a long semester. A lot of work goes into the planning and execution of Formal and Semiformal, so they are each managed by their own chair. Omicron Iota is also active in WPI’s intramural sports program. Our chapter has put together teams for events that include flag football, basketball, indoor soccer and volleyball, and we are excited to resume competing when it is safe to do so. Like Formal and Semiformal, intramurals take an extra level of work to organize, and they are led by a dedicated Intramurals chair.

<div class="row"> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Like so much else in our lives, fellowships have been deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. While this crisis is ongoing, members cannot meet in person to hang out, share food, and explore Worcester like we used to. We are saddened by this, but fellowships have continued to unite us despite the circumstances. Members are still able to spend time together through online movie and game nights. More recently, we have had the opportunity to hold virtual fellowships with the Nu Alpha and Theta Zeta chapters and experience the common ground shared by Alpha Phi Omega members nationwide. We have also mixed up our virtual fellowship offerings with occasional in-person fellowships, which have provided a lot of fun while keeping all participants safe and socially-distant. Fellowships have definitely changed under COVID-19, and we are excited for when we can return to our old traditions. Nonetheless, the spirit of friendship remains strong in Alpha Phi Omega, and it will continue to do so until this difficult time has passed.
